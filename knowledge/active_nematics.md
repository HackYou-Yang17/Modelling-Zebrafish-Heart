## What is Active Nematics?

`Nematic Order`:    This is a type of order found in liquid crystals. The constituent 
                    units (rods, filaments, cells) have no positional order (they can flow like a liquid) but they have long-range orientational order (they all 'face' the same way). The common direction is defined by a "director" field.

`Activity`:         The system is driven out of equilibrium by internal energy 
                    consumption. The constituent units are generating their own forces (e.g., molecular motors converting ATP into mechanical work). This activity injects mechanical stress into the system, leading to spontaneous flows and distinctive dynamics.

`Director Field`:   Measures the direction and degree of alignment of the local nematic 
                    orientation.

The combination of order and activity leads to different behaviors, most notably the continuous creation and annihilation of topological defects (points where the director field is undefined). These defects are not static; they drive flows, organize the material, and can even become motile.


## Nematic Order of Muscle Cells
`Micro-to-Macro`
Actin + Myosin Filaments < Sarcomeres < Myofibrils < Cardiomyocyte < Muscle Tissue
`Nematic Order`
They are aligned in a nematic fashion in a long-term direction.
`Activity`
Sarcomeres consume ATP to drive motion. They contract and expand, injecting substantial, periodic mechanical stress into the tissue.


## Nematic Phases


## Topological Defects
A topological defect is a spot where order breaks down. It's a point where you can't define a single direction anymore.

### Main 2D Topoligical Defects
`The +1/2 Defect:`      The "Comet"

`What it looks like:`   It has a head and a tail. The rods seem to splay out from a     
                        central point, but in a lopsided way. It looks like a comet.

`Its Key Feature:`  It has a built-in direction (its polarity), which is the vector 
                    from its core to its "head."

Because of its lopsided shape and the internal pushing of the rods, the active forces add up to push it in the direction of its "head." It actively swims through the material!

`The -1/2 Defect:`      The "Three-Armed Star" (Mercedes logo)

`What it looks like:`   It has a three-fold symmetry. The rods point in three different 
                        directions around the core.

`Its Key Feature:`  It is symmetric. It doesn't have a preferred direction.

Because of its symmetric shape, all the active pushes cancel each other out. It doesn't have a preferred direction of motion. It just gets carried along by the flows created by the +1/2 defects.

### The Life Cycle of Active Defects
The chaos of "active turbulence" is driven by a constant dance of defects:

`Birth (Creation):`     The internal activity (pushing/pulling) builds up stress in the 
                        nematic. This stress can become so great that the ordered arrangement "rips," and a pair of defects—one +1/2 and one -1/2—spontaneously comes into existence.

`Life (Motion and Interaction):`    The +1/2 defect zooms off in one direction. The -1/
                                    2 defect gets left behind or is swept up in flows.They move around, influencing each other and the fluid flow. The flow from one defect can attract or repel others.

`Death (Annihilation):`     Eventually, a speedy +1/2 defect might find a -1/2 defect. 
                            When they meet, they cancel each other out, and the orderly nematic arrangement is restored in that area.


## Polar & Apolar
`Polar`:    Structured constituents that allow their compenents to move in organised 
            ways. Includes polar particles and active stress. Potentially brough about by internally driven motility. p != p

`Apolar`:   Head-tail symmetric constituents interacting through relative orientation 
            without directional preference (no 'head' or 'tail'). The constituents are bidirectional. They exhibit long-range orientational order but no positional order. n == -n
